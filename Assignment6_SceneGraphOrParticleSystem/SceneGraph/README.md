## Description

We have learned how to draw models in the previous assignment(s) using
the OBJ file format for loading an objects geometry. Additionally,
throughout the course we have learned some abstractions to help enable
us in creating larger graphical scenes with many objects
(e.g. std::vector). However, it can quickly become difficult to manage
many different objects in a scene, especially when those scenes are
large. In order to create larger graphical scenes, a scenegraph is the
dominate data structure used by graphics programmers for organizing
data in a scene. For this assignment, we will be focusing on
implementing a [scene
graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph) and understanding
how transformations of one object are propogated to others.
  
### Assignment Strategy

In order to get started with this assignment, I recommend reading this
short .pdf [Read this tutorial](./media/SceneGraphs.pdf). The provided
tutorial should give you a nice theoretical and applied example of
what you are implementing. Note for this assignment, there *should*
not be many code changes required.
  
## Scenegraphs

A scenegraph is nothing more than a 'tree' data structure. There is a
root of some 'object' at the top, and then every other object that
exists is added into a single tree. There may additionally be other
'nodes' in the tree that have meaning in our 3D scene. For example,
lighting, a camera, rigid bodies(for physical simulations), or
transformations.

Here is an example of a scenegraph in a graphics scene.

 ### SceneNode.h

In our scenegraph, we only have one type of node (SceneNode). SceneNodes contain the following information:

```cpp
 protected:
     // Parent
     SceneNode* parent;
 private:
     // Children holds all a pointer to all of the descendents
     // of a particular SceneNode. A pointer is used because
     // we do not want to hold or make actual copies.
     std::vector<SceneNode*> children;
     // The object stored in the scene graph
     Renderable* object;  // May be nullptr!
     // Each SceneNode nodes locals transform.
     QMatrix4x4 localTransform;
     // We additionally can store the world transform
     QMatrix4x4 worldTransform;
```

Notice that a SceneNode has a transformation and geometry embedded
within them. SceneNode's also know who their parent node is, and all
of their children. You may think about how and why we have a local and
a world transform stored for our node.
  
Again, the majority of this assignment is understanding how to perform
a tree traversal and apply transformations from one object
successively to the next.  I have provided a file (Sphere.h) that will
help you generate sphere geometry.  You will need to integrate this
into the project.

## Part 1 - Usage of Scene graph

## Task 1 - Solar System

For this assignment you are going to create a solar system.

This involves the following:
- Figuring out how to do the scenegraph transformation (stated above).
- Modify `SceneNode::Update(...)` to make sure transformations are pushed from the parent to the child.
- Next, create a solar system with at least 3 planets, and 6 moons.
	- There is a sample provided in: `BasicWidget::update()` in our previous labs for how to update frames based on timings.
	- Feel free to be creative. You may even modify the shader to achieve more interesting renderings of the planets(e.g. scrolling the textures or trying to make them 'glow').

## Task 2 - Why is our scenegraph efficient?

In a few sentences why is our approach of storing a local and world
transform more efficient than doing a depth-first traversal to find
the final position of an object in world space? Note: There is a handy
[tutorial](./media/SceneGraphs.pdf) in the repository including more
information on scenegraphs which may help you answer.
  
**Answer here**: *Your answer here*
  
## How to run your program

Your solution should compile using the standard CMake build procedure. 

Your program should then run by typing in: `./lab`  


## Deliverables

- A solar system with at least 3 planets and 6 moons.
- Edit the readme to answer Task 2

* You need to commit your code to this repository.

## Going Further

* Try drawing the orbits for the planets and moons (This will make things just slightly cooler looking)
* Try implementing a custom 'planet shader' for each of the planets.
	* For instance, scrolling the uv coordinates on the Sun may make it have an interesting effect!

## F.A.Q
